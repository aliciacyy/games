## Game Information

![image info](assets/pdmm-cover.jpg)

**Game Title:** Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA Mega Mix

**Release Date:** May 15th 2020

**Platform:** Nintendo Switch

## Introduction

- I record my **Hard** gameplay of this game in **Arcade Mode**
- My main challenge is to get at least an **Excellent** grade for all 141 Hard songs
- A side challenge is to get into the top 500 rankings at the same time
- This is a WIP and I will continue to update the list until all 141 songs are uploaded

## Rank Information
- Online ranking for Hard only records the top 500 scores
- Date refers to the date of the screenshot taken, and will not be updated
- Due to the possible fluctuating high scores, it is highly likely that the ranks recorded here will be outdated
- I will definitely not be able to achieve a rank for all songs due to varying difficulties and interests
